1. Gene Expression Analysis Tool
Develop a tool that allows users to upload genetic data and visualize gene expression profiles. This could include heatmaps or other graphical representations to help identify patterns relevant to diseases or treatments.

2. Virtual Lab Simulator
Create an interactive web-based lab where users can simulate different laboratory techniques such as PCR, electrophoresis, or CRISPR. This could help students and professionals practice lab procedures in a virtual environment.

3. Drug Interaction Predictor
Develop a model that predicts potential adverse drug interactions based on user-inputted medication lists. This tool could use a database of known drug interactions and apply machine learning to predict risks.

4. Disease Outbreak Prediction Model
Using historical data and machine learning, build a model that predicts potential outbreaks of diseases based on factors like climate changes, population density, and travel patterns.

5. 3D Tissue Engineering Visualization
Implement a 3D visualization tool that lets users explore different aspects of tissue engineering, such as cell growth on various scaffolds or the effects of different growth factors on cell regeneration.

6. Neural Network Playground
Create an interactive web page where users can design and train basic neural networks. Users could experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and other parameters to see how they affect the performance on sample datasets.

7. Bioinformatics Sequence Alignment Tool
Offer a tool that performs DNA, RNA, or protein sequence alignments and provides detailed reports on similarities, differences, and potential functional implications of the alignments.

8. Environmental Impact Calculator
Develop a calculator that estimates the environmental impact of various chemicals or biotech processes. This could be aimed at helping companies understand and reduce their carbon footprint or other environmental impacts.

9. AI-based Diagnostic Imaging Tool
This project could involve using AI to analyze medical images such as X-rays or MRIs to detect abnormalities or diseases. The focus could be on increasing accuracy and reducing the time needed for diagnosis.

10. Customizable Microarray Data Processor
A web application that allows researchers to upload microarray data, apply various normalization and analysis techniques, and visualize the results dynamically.
